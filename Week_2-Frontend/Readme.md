# Week 2 – Frontend Fundamentals & Capstone

This week focused on strengthening my frontend foundations by building real UI components using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks)**. The goal was to understand core concepts deeply and apply them through hands-on projects, ending with a complete capstone project.

## 🗓️ Weekly Breakdown

### Day 1 – Semantic HTML

* Built a blog listing page using **only semantic HTML**
* Focused on accessibility and meaningful document structure
* Used semantic tags such as:

  * `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`

**Learning:**
Writing proper semantic HTML improves accessibility, SEO, and makes CSS/JS integration easier.

### Day 2 – CSS Layout (Flexbox & Grid)

* Built complex layouts using:

  * **Flexbox** for one-dimensional layouts (header, sidebar)
  * **CSS Grid** for two-dimensional layouts (content sections)
* Created a centered wrapper layout
* Implemented **mobile-first responsive design**

**Learning:**
Flexbox is best for alignment in one direction, while Grid is ideal for structured layouts with rows and columns.

---

### Day 3 – JavaScript & DOM Manipulation

* Practiced modern JavaScript (ES6+)
* Built an interactive **FAQ Accordion**
* Learned:

  * Event listeners
  * DOM traversal
  * Managing UI state without frameworks

**Learning:**
UI behavior should be driven by application state, not direct DOM manipulation hacks.

---

### Day 4 – JavaScript Utilities & LocalStorage

* Built a **Todo App** with:

  * Add, Edit, Delete functionality
  * Persistent data using `localStorage`
* Wrote clean, modular JavaScript functions
* Practiced error handling and debugging

**Learning:**
Persisting data makes applications feel real and highlights the importance of managing state correctly.
